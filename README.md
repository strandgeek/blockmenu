**Project Goal**:
The goal of the BlockMenu project is to provide a decentralized and cost-effective solution for restaurant management. By leveraging blockchain technology and BTTC cryptocurrency, our app aims to simplify the menu management, order receiving, and payment processes for restaurant owners while offering a seamless and convenient experience for their customers. We also aim to promote financial inclusivity by allowing customers without a BTCC wallet to still enjoy the benefits of our app. Our ultimate goal is to transform the restaurant industry by providing an innovative and accessible solution that enhances the overall dining experience for everyone involved.

* Order Receiving: Receive orders from customers through the app and keep track of them in real-time
* Payment Processing: Accept payments in BTTC cryptocurrency through a secure and decentralized payment system
* Staff Management: Add and manage waiters and admins with different levels of access to the app
* Appearance Configuration: Customize the app's appearance to match your restaurant's brand and style
* Off-Chain Orders: Customers without a BTTC wallet can still view the menu and the waiter can register the orders and mark the bill as paid off-chain.
* Tips: Automatically transfer tips to waiters through the app's smart contract feature when a bill is paid

Update:

As the project is aiming to be a real-life use case, during the Hackathon, we made a pivot from using TRON to BitTorrent-Chain as the main chain for the dApp. This decision was made with the aim of providing a more affordable platform for users, given the low fees associated with using BitTorrent-Chain.
